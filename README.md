# Poker Hand Evaluator

<h2> This project consists in a game where the user gives an integer (from 1 to 52) array of length 10, representing two hands. It returns the winning hand as an string array with the number and suit of each card. Jack, queen and king are represented by 11, 12, 13 respectively. This game was implemented in three different languages (Smalltalk representing the object-oriented paradigm, Elixir and Haskell representing the functional paradigm). </h2>

<h3>Note that the Smalltalk version is a .zip archive that contains a Pharo Image. You have to download Pharo and load the image in order to see the code.</h3>
